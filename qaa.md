**1. App Vision & Core Goal:**
Beyond the core functionality (inline AI suggestions), what's the ultimate *feeling* or *benefit* you want users to get from GhostTyper?
a) Faster writing
b) More confident writing
c) Overcoming writer's block
d) Other: [Please specify]
*Suggestion:* b) More confident writing, as it encompasses speed and overcoming blocks.
**Answer:** e all of the above. The goal is to provide a seamless writing experience that enhances productivity and creativity.

**2. Target Browsers:**
Which browsers should GhostTyper initially support?
a) Google Chrome only
b) Chrome & Firefox
c) Chrome, Firefox, Edge
d) Other: [Please specify]
*Suggestion:* a) Google Chrome only, as it's the most popular and simplifies initial development. We can plan for others later.
**Answer:** a) Google Chrome only. This will allow us to focus on a single platform for the initial release and ensure a smooth user experience.

**3. AI Model Integration:**
You provided a Gemini code snippet. Are we settling on using Google's Gemini models?
a) Yes, use Gemini (as per the code snippet).
b) Prefer OpenAI (GPT-3.5/4).
c) Prefer Anthropic (Claude).
d) Explore options / Need a recommendation.
*Suggestion:* a) Yes, use Gemini. This aligns with the provided code and offers a strong balance of capability and potential cost-effectiveness.
**Answer:** a) Yes, use Gemini. This will allow us to leverage the capabilities of Google's AI models and provide a seamless experience for users.

**4. API Key Management:**
How will users provide their AI model's API key?
a) User inputs it directly into the extension's settings page, stored locally in browser storage. (Simpler, user controls key)
b) User authenticates with our backend, and the backend manages the API key securely (via user account). (More complex, enables potential subscription models, central control, potentially higher security if done right).
c) The extension comes pre-configured with a key (Not recommended for user-specific models like Gemini/OpenAI due to cost and security).
*Suggestion:* a) User inputs it directly and stores it locally. This is the simplest approach for a utility extension and puts the user in control of their API costs.
**Answer:** b) User inputs it directly into the extension's settings page, stored locally in browser storage. This allows users to manage their own API keys and ensures that they have control over their usage.

**5. Suggestion Trigger Mechanism:**
When should GhostTyper request and show suggestions?
a) On every keystroke (Potentially expensive and distracting).
b) After the user pauses typing for a short duration (e.g., 500ms). (Good balance)
c) Only when the user presses a specific hotkey. (More user control, less 'ambient')
d) Other: [Please specify]
*Suggestion:* b) After the user pauses typing. This feels natural, like Copilot, and avoids excessive API calls.
**Answer:** b) After the user pauses typing for a short duration (e.g., 500ms). This will help reduce unnecessary API calls and provide a smoother user experience. provide settings for the delay time in the options page.

**6. Suggestion Presentation:**
How should the AI suggestions appear?
a) As inline, slightly faded text right after the cursor, accepted with 'Tab'. (Like GitHub Copilot)
b) In a small popup window near the text cursor.
c) In a dedicated side panel.
*Suggestion:* a) Inline faded text. This matches the "Copilot for writing" analogy and feels seamless.
**Answer:** d) all of the above. The inline faded text will be the default, but we can also provide a small popup window and a dedicated side panel for users who prefer those options based on settings.

**7. Configuration Options:**
What settings should users be able to control via the extension's options page? (Select all that apply)
a) Enter/Update AI API Key
b) Enable/Disable GhostTyper globally
c) Enable/Disable GhostTyper for specific websites (allow/block list)
d) Adjust suggestion delay timing
e) Choose different AI model variations (if applicable, e.g., different Gemini models)
f) Option to clear stored API key/data
*Suggestion:* a, b, c, d, f. Start with the essentials: API key management, global toggle, site-specific control, and data clearing. Others can be added later.
**Answer:** a, b, c, d, f.

**8. Backend Requirements:**
Given the goal of a "final product" and potential future needs, should we plan for a backend even if initial features (like local API key storage) don't strictly require it? The `backend/` folder was requested.
a) Yes, include a basic backend structure (e.g., Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI) even if it's minimal initially. This allows for future features like user accounts, shared prompts, analytics, or centralized API key proxying.
b) No, focus entirely on the extension (frontend) for now. Add a backend only if absolutely necessary later.
*Suggestion:* a) Yes, set up the `backend/` folder structure with a minimal framework. It aligns with the request and makes future expansion much smoother. We can keep it dormant initially if local API key storage is used.
**Answer:** a) Yes, include a basic backend structure (e.g., Node.js/Express ) even if it's minimal initially. This allows for future features like user accounts, shared prompts, analytics, or centralized API key proxying.

**9. Performance Considerations:**
How critical is minimizing any typing lag introduced by the extension?
a) Extremely critical. Any noticeable lag is unacceptable.
b) Important, but minor, occasional delays are okay if suggestions are valuable.
c) Standard performance is fine.
*Suggestion:* a) Extremely critical. Real-time typing assistance must feel instantaneous. This impacts choices around debouncing, API call timing, and efficient DOM manipulation.
**Answer:** a) Extremely critical. Real-time typing assistance must feel instantaneous. This impacts choices around debouncing, API call timing, and efficient DOM manipulation.

**10. Security Focus:**
Besides API key security (if stored locally), are there other specific security concerns?
a) Primary concern is the user's API key stored locally. Ensure it uses secure browser storage (`chrome.storage.local` or equivalent) and isn't easily accessible.
b) Also concerned about potential injection vulnerabilities if manipulating web page content directly.
c) Need to ensure any backend communication (if added) uses HTTPS and proper authentication.
*Suggestion:* a, b, c. All are relevant. Secure local storage is paramount for option 4a. Careful DOM interaction is needed to avoid breaking websites or introducing XSS risks. Standard security practices apply if a backend is used.
**Answer:** a, b, c. All are relevant. Secure local storage is paramount for option 4a. Careful DOM interaction is needed to avoid breaking websites or introducing XSS risks. Standard security practices apply if a backend is used.

**11. Monetization Strategy:**
Does GhostTyper have a planned monetization model, or is it intended to be free?
a) Completely Free / Open Source.
b) Freemium (basic features free, advanced features paid).
c) Paid (one-time purchase or subscription).
*Suggestion:* a) Completely Free. This is common for utility extensions relying on user-provided API keys.
**Answer:** a) Completely Free. This is common for utility extensions relying on user-provided API keys. We can consider monetization options later if the extension gains traction.

**12. Success Metrics (KPIs):**
How will you measure if GhostTyper is successful?
a) Number of downloads/installs.
b) Number of active daily/weekly users.
c) Suggestion acceptance rate (how often users press Tab).
d) User ratings and reviews.
e) Combination of b, c, and d.
*Suggestion:* e) Combination of active users, acceptance rate, and ratings. This gives a holistic view of usage, utility, and user satisfaction. (Note: Measuring acceptance rate requires some basic, anonymous telemetry, potentially needing the backend).
**Answer:** e) Combination of b, c, and d. This gives a holistic view of usage, utility, and user satisfaction. (Note: Measuring acceptance rate requires some basic, anonymous telemetry, potentially needing the backend).

**13. Design & UI/UX:**
Do you have any existing wireframes, mockups, or specific design ideas you'd like to share or describe? Or should we rely on the "Copilot-style" inline suggestion and a standard browser extension options page?
*Suggestion:* Rely on the Copilot-style interaction and a clean, standard options page for simplicity unless you have specific designs.
**Answer:** a) We should rely on the "Copilot-style" inline suggestion for a seamless user experience, along with a standard options page for easy configuration.

**14. Handling Edge Cases & Errors:**
How should the extension behave if...
a) The user's API key is invalid or quota is exceeded? (Show an error icon/notification? Disable suggestions?)
b) The AI service is down or slow? (Timeout gracefully? Indicate loading/error?)
c) GhostTyper encounters an incompatible input field? (Silently disable itself for that field?)
*Suggestion:*
a) Show a persistent error icon on the extension button, and a clear message in the options page. Disable suggestions until fixed.
b) Indicate loading (subtly), timeout after a reasonable period (e.g., 5-10 seconds), and show a temporary error state (e.g., icon change).
c) Silently disable itself for incompatible fields to avoid breaking website functionality.
**Answer:** all of the above. This will ensure that users are informed of any issues and that the extension does not interfere with their browsing experience.

**15. Documentation & Handover:**
The request mentions the AI agent should produce well-documented, maintainable code. Is there anything specific you want to emphasize for the documentation (e.g., setup instructions, code comments, architecture overview)?
*Suggestion:* Emphasize clear setup instructions (including getting an API key), detailed comments for complex logic (especially API interaction and DOM manipulation), and a brief `README.md` in both `extension/` and `backend/` explaining the purpose and structure.
**Answer:** We should focus on providing comprehensive documentation that covers setup, usage, and maintenance to facilitate future development and user understanding.
